## Data Collection
The dataset consists of 10,000+ Amazon product reviews, which were collected for sentiment analysis.

## Model Details
Sentiment Scoring with VADER  

Utilized NLTKâ€™s SentimentIntensityAnalyzer to handle tokenization, lowercasing, stop-word filtering, and scoring.  
Logistic Regression Model  

Input features: Three VADER scores (positive, neutral, negative).  
Implemented class_weight='balanced' to address class imbalance.  
Training: 90% of the data; Testing: 10%.  
Evaluation & Results    
Accuracy: 93%  
Neutral/Negative Recall: Improved from 0% to 100%  
Visualized results with a confusion matrix and a sentiment distribution pie chart.  
## Key Findings
Approximately 90% of reviews were positive, but VADER missed some Neutral/Negative groups.  
The balanced weights strategy successfully captured all Neutral and Negative reviews.    
A few Positive reviews were shifted into minority classes, which is an acceptable trade-off to eliminate blind spots.
